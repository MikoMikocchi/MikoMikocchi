I'm new to C# and want to develop in this programming language, although I learned a bit of Java and C++ before that a couple years ago, so C# is much easier for me now than if I had learned it from scratch.
Learning a programming language was originally conceived to create my own game, but it could also be something that would bring me bread, which is why I'm here now.

I know too little yet, so you can't expect big and frequent commits from me yet. However, this may change in the near future, because I want to evolve.
